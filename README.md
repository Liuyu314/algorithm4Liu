# algorithm4Liu

I start a new project named algorithm4Liu aimming to record my study of algorithm. The book I use is *Introduction To Algorithm*. Through the study I hope to be a programmer not a coder.

I know this is a very long and hard way, so be a fighter and god bless me. Actually it's none business of the god, it needs my hardworking! :)

## test

You can input *make test* to test the algorithm. Some testing time may be a little long, you can change the data scale through the *test.sh*. After testing, you can see the picture like this:

![plot](https://raw.github.com/Liuyu314/algorithm4Liu/master/plot.png)

If no, try to download the *matplotlib*, and make sure your python is 2.7 or later. The system I use is OS X 10.8.4.

I will update the testing next time to be more intelligentã€‚
